\title{
Sample Expectiles
}
\description{
Expectiles are fitted to univariate samples with least asymmetrically weighted squares for asymmetries between 0 and 1.
For graphical representation an expectile - expectile plot is available. The corresponding functions \code{\link[stats]{quantile}}, \code{\link[stats]{qqplot}}
and \code{\link[stats]{qqnorm}} are mapped here for expectiles.
}
\usage{
expectile(x, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25), dec = 4)

eenorm(y, main = "Normal E-E Plot",
       xlab = "Theoretical Expectiles", ylab = "Sample Expectiles",
       plot.it = TRUE, datax = FALSE, ...)
       
eeplot(x, y, plot.it = TRUE, xlab = deparse(substitute(x)),
       ylab = deparse(substitute(y)), main = "E-E Plot", ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x, y}{
Numeric vector of univariate observations.
}
  \item{probs}{
Numeric vector of asymmetries between 0 and 1 where 0.5 corresponds to the mean.  
}
  \item{dec}{
Number of decimals remaining after rounding the results.  
}
  \item{plot.it}{
logical. Should the result be plotted?
}
  \item{datax}{
logical. Should data values be on the x-axis? 
}
  \item{xlab, ylab, main}{
plot labels. The xlab and ylab refer to the x and y axes respectively if \code{datax} = TRUE.
}
  \item{\dots}{
graphical parameters. 
}
}
\details{
In least asymmetrically weighted squares (LAWS) each expectile is fitted independently from the others.
LAWS minimizes:

\eqn{ S = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{ w_i(p)(x_i - \mu(p))^2} }

with

\eqn{ w_i(p) = p 1_{(x_i > \mu(p))} + (1-p) 1_{(x_i < \mu(p))} }.

\eqn{\mu(p)} is determined by iteration process with recomputed weights \eqn{w_i(p)}.
}
\value{
Numeric vector with the fitted expectiles.
